# Matrix-Transformations
Some matrix transformations used in 3D computer graphics.

Objects are positioned and moved with geometric transformations. There are 3 different methods in this code.
Scale matrix, translation matrix and rotation matrix, which has three different rotations x,y and z.

Viewing transformations consists of the two methods orthogonal matrix and perspective matrix. Those matrices use a frustum of a pyramid
with the values left, right, top, bottom, near and far.
